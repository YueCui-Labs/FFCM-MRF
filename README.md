# FFCM-MRF: An accurate and generalizable cerebrovascular segmentation pipeline for humans and rhesus monkeys based on TOF-MRA
FFCM-MRF is an open-source MATLAB GUI for ToF-MRA data preprocessing, cerebrovascular segmentation and quantification. It is capable of accurately segmenting intracranial cerebrovascular structures, despite variations in scanner platforms, sequences, and species.

For detailed information using FFCM-MRF, please refer to the manual.pdf file.
